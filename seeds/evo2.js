It was a a steam ship with initials HMT, which stands for Her Majesty Transport and it was used to carry troops as a troop ship. The ship was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Govan Shipyard, Glasgow, Scotland. The keel of the ship (designed as Ship No 75) was laid down with 8,396 UK tons (8.531 Metric Tonnes) of steel for the hull of the ship. Oxfordshire was launched on 15th December 1955 by Lady Dorothea Head who was wife of Lord Head ( Minister for War ). It took over a year to fit out the whole ship and so her sea trials did not start until 29th January 1957. During her sea trials Oxfordshire attained a maximum speed of 20.79 knots and an average of 19.78 knot (36.63 kph), so she wasn't a fast classic ship, especially when you compare her to QE2. She can be seen in the photo below doing her sea trials off.",

Oxfordshire was able to carry 1000 troops, 500 passengers (who were usually families of the troops) and 409 crew. Oxfordshire's maiden voyage began on 28th February 1957, when she left Liverpool under command of Captain Norman Fitch and travelled to Hong Kong via Capetown, South Africa. During Oxfordshires time as a troop ship, she made an average of four trips per year between Great Britain and the Far East. She frequently called at the following ports of Ceylon (Now called Sri Lanka), Aden (Yemen) and Port Said and Suez in Egypt. By the early 60's transport through air by an aircraft become more popular and so trooping by sea was losing it's popularity. On 1962 Oxfordshire was taken out of service as a troop ship.",

I am fortunate enough to have travelled on her in December 1990 when I was young boy. I remember when I was on it, it had a excellent usage of deck space for a keep fit area, nightclub, buffet and blank shooting off the back deck. The only drawback we had as a family, was that my parents and sister got sick from the buffet food. This is one area that has improved in recent times with cruise ships, is that the buffets are much better controlled for food quality. Other than that it was an awesome cruise and brings back fond memories of snorkelling in Champagne Bay and exploring Noumea, Fiji and Vanuatu.

                final_2nd_para: " During her time, Fairstar can be remembered as the most popular Cruise Ship that sailed out of Sydney. Since her first Australian based cruise in Sydney back in December 1974, she has taken almost one million passengers on cruises and travelled more than two million nautical miles, which is equal to 251 times around the world or four times to the moon and back. Also it can be noted that she had passed the Sydney Opera House over 1,100 times. In her final moments, the name Fairstar was removed, she was renamed RIPA very faintly on the top of her bow and she was now registered with a new port (Saint Vincent and Grenadines). On February 5th, 1997 she left Sydney for the last time and went to the ship breakers in Alang, India to be broken up. The reality was that even though she still looked like a nice looking ship, new SOLAS (which stands for Safety of Life at Sea) safety requirements came in to effect in 1997 and sadly Fairstar had several major problems like brickwork coming off her boliers and her engines were not holding up very well over the final years. Fairstar is a ship that has sadly passed, but will never be forgotten for her lovely cruises in the Pacific Islands.",

She was built at Wartsila Helsinki Shipyard in Helsinki, Finland and was completed in July 1973. Royal Viking Sky operated with Royal Viking Line, which was a well known Norwegian Cruise Company at the time and she was one of 3 sister ships (the others being Royal Viking Star and Royal Viking Sea). Royal Viking Sky was used for luxury cruises around the world, so this included places like North America, Europe and New Zealand.

Pullmaantur Cruises filed for financial reorganisation and the interior of the ship was stripped down for everything of value. For MS Sovereign to have continued she would of needed to have her equipment upgraded, but the cost of doing this meant that it was not worth while and she sadly had to be sent to the scrapyard in Aliaga, Turkey and she was beached on 23rd July 2020. It's the end of an incredible ship that has really transformed the cruise industry, she will be sadly missed, but her memories will be with us forever.",
