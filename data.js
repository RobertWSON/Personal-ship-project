    Review: 'I was on this ship for her maiden cruise from Port Canaveral. Amazingly big ship, so it was difficult to get to know everyone on board, like it is on the smaller ships. The activities however were excellent as there was a lot to choose from, like rock climbing, indoor cricket, tennis and touch rugby. The shows had lots of variety, ranging from argentinian and salsa dancing and singing from opera to songs with a comical side to them. I would recommend this ship to all variety of ages, as the passengers range from families, group of friends or loved ones on a trip.',

    Review: 'This ship has been sailing for Marella Cruises owned by UK company TUI. I sailed on it in 2018 and really enjoyed my Miami to Barbados and return cruise. The beautiful feeling of being on a cruise ship that has a good amount of cruising hsitory was felt with the onboard architecture and onboard display of past cruise history. Excellent rang of onboard activities like tennis and basketball facilities for people who enjoy a sporting challenge like myself. Barbados was a great highlight of the trip and the people there made you feel so welcome. However, Since covid it is now in retirement and is looking for a company to be sold to, so that it can continue cruising. When you click make a booking for this ship, the website tells you about what is happening with this ship.',
